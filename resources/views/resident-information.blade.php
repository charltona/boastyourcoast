			<h4>Will tourism cause congestion at my favourite restaurant or shopping district</h4>
			<p>No, Tourism improves the service quality in shops, restaurants and hotels due to having a higher number of people through the door. This means that these services and facilities can grow and adapt to accommodate the influx in customers.</p>
			</br>
			<h4>Will tourism drive up the price of every living on the Sunshine Coast</h4>
			<p>No it won’t. The more people in the area, the more money going to local businesses and supporting our community financially.</p>
